**Objective:**

Our goal as a team is the provide racing insights on both previous and upcoming races for the Churchill Downs racetrack. Even more in depth, using different programming languages and machine learning, we have created multiple ML models. These models can predict whether a horse is going to win or lose. 

**Methods:**

Retrieved the data from a reputable betting betting brand via SQL.  We cleaned the data with Pandas and stored the clean data into and S3 Bucket.  The cleaned data was then placed into a tableau workspace to preform analytics to gain actual insights into the data.  The clean data was also put through Machine Learning Algorithms to see what model would be the most reliable giving us true results.  The results were analysed for accuracy and precision.
