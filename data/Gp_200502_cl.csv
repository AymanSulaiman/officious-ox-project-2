"GP",05/02/2020,3,"Hard Lighting","Landed on the edges behind the future stakes winner Dr Post when debuting over seven furlongs, and has since worked thrice here on the main track; the average win distance of Hard Spun's offspring is a route-worthy 7.6 furlongs; Ky-bred is the first foalfrom a sprinter who banked $99K; jockey-trainer combo is 1 for 7 at the meet, and Delgado has solid stats with maiden second-time starters.   -Ron Gierkink"
"GP",05/02/2020,3,"Rag Tag","Hasn't shown much since commencing his career with a pair of seconds, but you can probably draw a line trough his last dull performance on the lawn because Union Rags is a dirt sire; Pletcher has a high win percentage going turf/dirt, and it wouldn't besurprising to see this Calumet Farm runner get back on the competitive track.   -Ron Gierkink"
"GP",05/02/2020,3,"Newsworthy","Three-time leading sire Tapit has produced 13% debut winners, and the average win distance of his progeny is 7.6 furlongs; mare won the G1 Test over seven furlongs, and was G1-placed going long; homebred is a full-brother to an unraced 4yo and a half-brother to Habub, a 5yo who earned $14K overseas; Hall-of-Famer Mott hit with 5% of his first-timers in dirt routes over the past five years ($1.21 ROI).   -Ron Gierkink"
"GP",05/02/2020,3,"Superfecto","Didn't much the smoothest of trips at first asking when up the track behind the promising Dr Post, who came back to take the $75K Unbridled Stakes in a gritty performance; Nicks has decent numbers with maiden second-timers, and is 0 for 4 at the meet when using Jaramillo (two those runners placed); son of the hot second-year sire Constitution is out of a router who produced the sprinter Spokane Eagle ($249K).   -Ron Gierkink"
"GP",05/02/2020,3,"Or'effice","Was not promoted from second in a controversial no-call regarding possible interference at the quarter pole in his latest, when he earned a fat 94 Beyer going 1 1/16 miles; Saez returns after a one-race absence, and was aboard for his narrow loss two back going nine furlongs in the slop; obvious favorite could join the Triple Crown trail with a strong winning performance.   -Ron Gierkink"
"GP",05/02/2020,3,"Ajhar","Checked in fifth in each of his February excursions--the winner of his debut subsequently ran second in a fast N1X, but his last race has yet to yield a next-out winner; son of Tapit is the second foal from a G2-winning dirt router and might welcome thestretchout from a one-turn mile to a two-turn 1 1/16 miles; Pletcher inherits the training duties from McLaughlin, who recently became the agent for Luis Saez.   -Ron Gierkink"
"GP",05/02/2020,3,"Cornbread Kingdom","Comes off a surprisingly poor showing in a fast-paced maiden special, which came on the heels of a distant fourth in another one-turn mile; son of Uncle Mo has yet to run to his good works, and is hard to recommend at this juncture.   -Ron Gierkink"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Onyx","Came into the Sanibel Island with a 3-for-3 record on turf, but she was exposed as a class below those fillies when never able to mount a challenge, eventually fading to last; in retrospect, she was beating inferior fields on grass here last summer and it's possible that she just hasn't matured during the time away; hard to endorse based on the return.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Bajan Girl","Gave the top trio a bit of a scare coming to the top of the stretch of the Gulfstream Park Oaks, as she threatened to break into the trifecta at odds of 105-1; ultimately flattened out in the last furlong, but nevertheless showed that she belongs againststakes fillies, at least on dirt; now she switches back to grass, and she had shown some promise on this surface; overcame a wide trip to be 4th in Feb. and then bulled her way through traffic to break her maiden two back; if Paco Lopez can save some ground from this wide draw, there's no reason she can't work herself into the mix once again; don't underestimate.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Astoria Kitten","NY-bred was bet down to even-money in her debut at Saratoga, but she wasn't quite ready for the spotlight that day; it was a different story next time out at Belmont as she delivered on that prior hype, drawing away authoritatively in the lane; Gargan picked a tougher open company assignment for her first test against winners at Aqueduct and she was in contention until midstretch before getting swallowed up late; now she returns from a break, and Gargan is 9-for-46 (20%, $2.27 ROI) off layoffs of 120 to240 days over the past 5 years; you know what the plan will be with speed rider Jaramillo on board; don't be shocked if she leads them a long way.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Stunning Sky","Showed some promise when she broke through on turf in that January optional claimer, but she wasn't able to sustain that positive momentum when she made her stakes debut in the Herecomesthebride; she fared much better in the Sanibel Island last time, asshe overcame a significant stretch deficit to get up for fourth; that wasn't exactly a race that favored horses coming from well off the pace, so she deserves full credit for the performance; there's a chance that she'll get more pace to close into thistime, and the extra sixteenth should help this sizable filly; picking up Gaffalione doesn't hurt either; exotics player.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Micheline","Deep closer arguably ran the best race of all in the Sweetest Chant two back when she made a wild rush from last to get up for second; one would have expected her to move forward off such a performance, but she didn't display any of that closing energy next time when a dull 7th in the Florida Oaks; though, she was hindered by a wide draw and Paco Lopez made the questionable decision to rush her up into a forward position early; she's probably better when she can take back and make one late rush, and that's what Bravo figures to do here; she's mildly interesting if she can repeat her prior effort; possible for a slice.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Pleasant Orb","MTO has done little wrong so far in her career, but she also hasn't run particularly fast; had to work hard to break out of the maiden ranks last time as the 7-5 favorite and will need to improve on that performance if she's to make her first start against winner a successful one; could be at a post position disadvantage if many of those entered for turf stay in.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Ginger Kitty","AE would be a potential pace factor if she drew into the race, a she had shown speed in her first few turf runs before a change in tactics backfired in the Herecomesthebride; yet the chief concern is her overall ability, as she was soundly defeated by Stunning Sky two back and that one has apparently improved since then; would be an outsider even if she got in.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Dream Marie","MTO picked up a valuable G2 placing when third in the Davona Dale two back, but she couldn't repeat the feat when never a serious factor in the Gulfstream Park Oaks last time; though, it is worth pointing out that the race featured a slow pace and was dominated by front-runners; clearly has ability, but if this race were rained off the turf, she'd be stuck with an unenviable outside post and a few to her inside have pretty strong dirt form.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Seducer","She was bet down to favoritism in the Sanibel Island last time despite having just one prior start under her belt at Aqueduct; while she was visually impressive in that initial run, keep in mind that she was racing over an intensely rail-biased course inNovember, which no doubt exaggerated her winning performance; while she was disappointing in her return, the change in tactics likely worked against her, as she never seemed totally comfortable racing in traffic; Irad Ortiz will need to use every bit ofskill to work out the right trip from this wide slot, and you'll take the worst of it from a price standpoint with him named to ride; mixed feelings.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Diamonds Are A","Stayed on mildly to split the field in the Wait a While last time, but now she hasn't been seen for 5 months; this is a pretty tough spot in which to launch a comeback, especially considering that she's not exactly on par with these fillies based on her2-year-old Beyers; leaning elsewhere.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Highland Glory","This filly is undefeated on turf and appears to have a good shot at making it 3-for-3; beat today's rival Mimina's Team to win a fast maiden heat in January, and then gutted out a narrow victory in the Sanibel Island; that most recent score is much stronger than the neck margin or 81 Beyer would suggest, as she raced 3- to 4-wide around both turns, covering 55 feet (approx. 6 lengths) more than the runner-up; this time she's drawn a much more favorable inside post position and the slight stretch-out to1 1/16 miles should only help; the sky's the limit for this full-sister to G1-placed turfer Highland Sky; the horse to beat.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Mimina's Team","The transition from maiden to stakes company can be tough, but she's faced some pretty solid fields in the maiden ranks this year; was hardly disgraced losing to Highland Sky in January, and the same can be said about her narrow loss to promising debut winner Linny Kate two back; she finally got the job done last time, but she did again display her tendency to shorten stride in the last eighth after making a rush to the lead in upper stretch; the good news is that she's going to be a much bigger price this time and she doesn't need to improve much on the Beyer scale to factor here; exotics player.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Ivyetsu","Daughter of Tapit is a bit of a head case; she blew the start in her debut and then threw a fit heading around the first turn in the Golden Rod; she gave her connections some hope that turf might be the answer when she closed well for 3rd in the SweetestChant, but she was back to her old antics last time in the Florida Oaks; she left the gate a good 3 lengths behind the field and then bore out into the first turn; considering that eventful start, she actually did quite well to rally for 5th; there's obviously ability here if she can ever put it all together; will be a square price if you're brave enough.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"La Rusia","You know what the plan will be in the early going; Berrios figures to try to make the front with this speedy filly; she might be able to accomplish that, but holding that advantage into the stretch seems like a tall order for this former claimer; she's never earned a Beyer that makes her particularly competitive here and she figures to encounter a more taxing pace setup than she's encountered recently; prefer others.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,9,"Envoutante","She earned an eye-catching 95 Beyer for her maiden victory, but we should probably take that number with a grain of salt; she was competing in the only dirt route of the day and the two horses who finished directly behind her also earned new top Beyers,improving by 20 and 23 points, respectively; it would be sensible to assess her off her prior form, and she's merely a fringe player based on those races; she handled the turf well enough in her debut, but she was never a threat to win that day while one-paced late; her tactical speed should ensure that she works out a good trip, but that may not be enough; leaning elsewhere.   -David Aragona"
"GP",05/02/2020,10,"Royal Squeeze","His six career wins over this distance are more than the rest of this field combined and he has the kind of speed from his outside draw that projects to play well in this field; is going to need his very best, assuming everyone shows up with their good race, but trips can go a long way in races like this and he projects to get a good one.   -Mike Beer"
"GP",05/02/2020,10,"Red Crescent","Underrated 6yo was in career-best form when last seen, winning back to back races - including a career-best 101 Beyer in his victory over this distance in October - and then finishing a good 4th in the Grade 3 Harlan's Holiday and just missing in the Sunshine Millions Classic; has a layoff to deal with but he handles this distance and is a threat if he can return in form.   -Mike Beer"
"GP",05/02/2020,10,"He Hate Me","Since winning that allowance race at Saratoga last summer, this guy has hit the board in the Tale of the Cat, the DeFrancis Dash, the Maryland Sprint Preview, the Pelican and the Sir Shackleton; couldn't win any of those races, and just wasn't good enough in that last one when sitting a good trip on the pace, but faces no one on the order of Vekoma this time and has the tactical speed to land the right kind of trip in this race.   -Mike Beer"
"GP",05/02/2020,10,"Noble Drama","Took advantage of a fast pace when getting the better of Red Crescent in the Sunshine Millions Classic two starts back then was no match in the Grade 2 Challenger last time; hasn't done much sprinting but he returned from the layoff in December in good form; needs some pace.   -Mike Beer"
"GP",05/02/2020,10,"Garter and Tie","His start in the Sir Shackelton last time was his first in over 240 days and he did not fire that day after getting outrun early and then trying a wide move around the turn; was a quality 2-and-3yo, especially in his one turn races; can do better here second off the layoff but needs some pace to help his cause.   -Mike Beer"
"GP",05/02/2020,10,"Last Judgment","Thought this well-connected colt ran well in his first start of the year following a long layoff as he was away last from the rail and then bothered by a green rival early losing more position, but he made a nice run coming around that field wide and easily put that race away while earning a 91 Beyer; stepped up last time and never made a serious run in the Sir Shackleton but may be able to rebound here.   -Mike Beer"
"GP",05/02/2020,10,"Network Effect","Prior to taking a shot in the Cigar Mile late last year this colt has won twice and finished 2nd in a pair of graded stakes from his first four starts, while earning a series of solid figures; was defeated as the favorite in a tough allowance race off the bench but had a real excuse there after breaking slowly and then appearing to clip heels and stumble shortly after the start; still finished gamely trying to catch the loose-on-the-lead winner and is a big threat in here with a better trip.   -Mike Beer"
"GP",05/02/2020,10,"With Verve","Enters off back to back wins over this track and is fresh off the upset in the Hutcheson, where he rallied gamely from last to just get up; heading the right way with consecutive new Beyer tops in those races but has to get faster again in order to contend here.   -Mike Beer"
"GP",05/02/2020,11,"Express Pharoah","It seems a bit odd that while American Pharoah did his superstar work on dirt, he seems more adroit at getting talented turf runners, at least at this early stage of his stud career; this colt certainly looks headed the right way; shown versatility, too,as he rallied to be a good 2nd on this course March 7 then led all the way while gamely holding on to beat maidens here last time out April 5; of course, today it's first time vs. winners, no small hurdle, but could be he's figuring out things and his speed and versatility give his rider options from the rail.   -Michael Hammersly"
"GP",05/02/2020,11,"South Bend","Winless in 3 turf starts but don't let that stat fool you as he's run well in all 3 (3rd, 3rd, 2nd), as all were stakes and all on this course; came from way out of it in his last 2 but when he nearly won the Dania Beach here Feb. 1, his first turf try,he showed plenty of speed to be in it from the start; worked well of late and you have to like how his Beyers are creeping north.   -Michael Hammersly"
"GP",05/02/2020,11,"Extraordinary","MTO cost a pretty penny ($750K) so you know there are expectations here; looked super blasting maidens on this dirt March 14 so he's got talent; would surely love to get a shot at a bunch of turf horses playing on his footing, too; showed ample speed that day so he can be in it from the start and if this gets washed off onto a wet main track he's bred all over to relish such going.   -Michael Hammersly"
"GP",05/02/2020,11,"Gufo","First 3 starts, all on turf, were quite good; no surprise he likes turf as his only 2 sibs are turf winners including the terrific Hogy (55-19-13-7, $1.3 million, 10 wins on turf, 9 SWs including 3 G3s, 13 SPs including 2 G2s, 2 G3s); finished with gustoto get up to beat winners here March 27 and a bullet work since is most encouraging; that said, his deep-closing style means he needs all the breaks in terms of pace and traffic and in a big, bulky field that could be a problem, and from a wagering standpoint a problematic embrace at a short price.   -Michael Hammersly"
"GP",05/02/2020,11,"Fame to Famous","After a few months off they took a swing at the Ky. Derby trail when trying the G2 Risen Star on FG dirt Feb. 15 but that didn't go well; no matter, they returned to turf, the footing on which he'd done well last year, here March 27 to get him back on track; well, that didn't go well either making you wonder if he hasn't come back quite the same horse who'd shown turf talent in NY last summer/fall; at least there's no panicky class drop but he's still facing some toughies and didn't get any help from the draw, either.   -Michael Hammersly"
"GP",05/02/2020,11,"Summer to Remember","Made a smart move into the lane in a stakes here last time out March 28 but flattened out in the final furlong to end up 4th; could be that since he was farther back than usual he had to use more fuel to get into the race, thus his tiring late; certainlyhas the speed to be prominent from the start and he's obviously proven on this course; must turn the tables on a couple of today's foes but this $200K son of G1 turf SW Summer Front figures to get a good trip.   -Michael Hammersly"
"GP",05/02/2020,11,"Buy Me Candy","Headed the right way; rallied smartly from far back to be 2nd in his turf debut at TAM Jan. 19, then showed more speed on FG sod March 5 before finishing strongly to win going away; faces winners for the first time but he certainly has talent and is obviously comfortable on this footing at this trip, and that he showed more speed in start No. 2 shows he's not one dimensional and that he can be placed in a good spot and get a nice trip; Correas IV has guided such turf standouts as the top-class turf mareDona Bruja.   -Michael Hammersly"
"GP",05/02/2020,11,"Ever Dangerous","Debut on this course at this trip April 2 was a beaut as this son of turf champ and crack turf sire Kitten's Joy stalked and then blasted home to win in a romp; not only is it tough to win first time out, to do so routing is an even bigger hurdle and this guy did it with ease; not only faces winners for the first time, but stakes foes and must do so with the worst of the draw; but he overcame a lot to win first time out so there's obviously lots of talent here.   -Michael Hammersly"
"GP",05/02/2020,11,"Doc Boy","Showed ample talent last summer on turf until he was very dull (12th) in a G3 on KEE turf Oct. 6; however, this $325K colt got time off after that and was back on track when he resurfaced at TAM March 7, finishing strongly for a SW; looks as though the freshening did the trick as he's back on his game; worked well since and Bravo, who was up for that smart TAM win, stays with him.   -Michael Hammersly"
"GP",05/02/2020,11,"Justinthenickotime","3rd and 2nd in his first 2 starts vs. winners, both on this course; trouble is, he was beaten by 6 lengths in each so it's not like he was a factor in the lane either time; the good news is that 2nd for $50K here last time out March 29 has been flattered(2 he faced came right back to win) and not only did Maker see fit to plunk down $50K to claim him, he brings him back where he can't lose him via another claim, in a stakes no less; certainly needs to improve to beat these but Maker's had a habit of buying at the right time.   -Michael Hammersly"
"GP",05/02/2020,11,"Proven Strategies","They thought enough of him last summer/fall to try a couple turf G1s as a maiden and he didn't run badly at all in either; was freshened and showed whey they had confidence when he returned as he blasted maidens here March 4 then romped over winners (inhand no less) here April 5; tossed back into stakes rank, certainly something he deserves after those last 2 big winning efforts; has the speed to be in it from the start though note some good work from just off the pace last year so if someone outruns him early, that's no problem.   -Michael Hammersly"
"GP",05/02/2020,11,"Island Commish","Toss that dirt sprint here Sept. 21 and you're left with nothing but good form, including 3 wins on turf in his last 3 starts, including taking G3 Kitten's Joy here Jan. 4; hasn't been seen since, which is a tad disconcerting as there have been plenty ofoptions for turfing 3yos this meet; the good news is he's been working superbly in the interim; has ample speed to be in the hunt from the start but is no need-the-lead type and he showed guts when outfinishing some decent 3yos for that Kitten's Joy win.   -Michael Hammersly"
"GP",05/02/2020,11,"Don Juan Kitten","Son of turf champ and crack turf sire Kitten's Joy showed turf ability at BEL last fall with 2 good outings to start his career; hasn't been seen since, which is a bit worrisome, though trainer Gargan has superb numbers off a long layoff like this; colthas been working in solid fashion for this return and it's most encouraging that Gaffalione, who has been the frequent rider for Proven Strategies next door ends up here instead, so read into that what you will.   -Michael Hammersly"
