"OP",05/02/2020,11,"Jungle Runner","This Candy Ride colt travels a bit awkwardly but liked his win the first time he was stretched out at Remington, which he then backed up nicely when becoming a stakes winner in the Clever Trevor; only earned a 66 Beyer for that stakes win and he has found the tougher competition to be too much to deal with since then; steps up again and is difficult to get behind in a race like this.   -Mike Beer"
"OP",05/02/2020,11,"Gouverneur Morris","Well-connected colt has been highly thought of from the start and has done little to disappoint with two wins and a Grade 1 placing from his first four starts; was supposed to win that 2020 debut at Tampa but liked that effort from him as he faced a solid field and overcame a bobble at the start to win while appearing to do enough to get something out of it; paired up the 88 Beyer when no threat in the Grade 1 Florida Derby last time and looks like the main threat to the favorite in here.   -Mike Beer"
"OP",05/02/2020,11,"Crypto Cash","Liked the way this colt progressed as a 2yo while taking steps forward from race to race and particularly liked his maiden win, where he came with a good finish to close down a game leader at the end; backed that race up with a gutsy win on turf where his versatility and gameness was on full display; don't goo too hard on him for that 3yo debut at Turfway where he stumbled badly at the start over a surface he didn't have to love.   -Mike Beer"
"OP",05/02/2020,11,"Shooters Shoot","Was making his fourth career start and ran really well when earning a 92 Beyer in that runnerup effort behind Charlatan back in February and has backed that effort up with two solid wins going a mile, which should give some perspective into how good thefavorite is; he may wind up using his early speed in this spot, though the last two wins while up with the pace may have had something to do with circumstance as he had inside draws and was forced to secure his position in those races; is going good right now and still has some upside; interesting.   -Mike Beer"
"OP",05/02/2020,11,"Winning Impression","Stretching out in distance has led to improvement for this gelding, though he still has a way to go to be competitive with horses like this; a wet track may win up being his best hope of being competitive here as he won easily over maidens in the slop last December and was also much the best last time over this track, despite taking a tough DQ in that race.   -Mike Beer"
"OP",05/02/2020,11,"Charlatan","There really isn't much to add to what is there on the page as, after two starts, this colt is considered by many to be the most talented 3yo in the country and that is saying something, considering that he is a stablemate trainer of the undefeated graded stakes winners Nadal and Authentic; faces tougher here as he takes on slightly more distance but his first two starts are both fast and visually compelling performances; going to be a strong favorite in here and is also going to take a ton of beating.   -Mike Beer"
"OP",05/02/2020,11,"Wrecking Crew","Overcame a bit of a slow start to win on debut and has made each of his five starts since in graded stakes company without success; there was a brief moment in the Juvenile last year when he loomed dangerously in behind the leaders, but he ultimately proved to be no match in that race, which had since turned out to be a negative key race; connections press on with this expensive 2yo purchase but he has to take a big step forward in his second start of the year.   -Mike Beer"
"OP",05/02/2020,11,"Anneau d'Or","Like Wrecking Crew, this colt ha his chance at the Juvenile last November but came away second-best; unlike many others exiting that race, this guy actually ran well in his follow up effort, though he once again failed to get by the leader in the stretchand settled for second-best; don't have to hold that 3yo debut against him but he did not run well in that slower division of the Risen Star and is hard to have a lot of confidence in now.   -Mike Beer"
"OP",05/02/2020,11,"Mo Mosa","Uncle Mo colt began on synthetic with some success and his first dirt start was an abject disaster when finishing last beaten over 40 lengths in the Grade 2 Tampa Bay Derby; was no match for Shooters Shoot in that allowance last time but he actually ranwell that day while putting in a good finish from far back and then galloping out well past the wire.   -Mike Beer"
"OP",05/02/2020,11,"Basin","Grade 1 winning 2yo had now made two starts back from the layoff and think he may be set to take a step forward here after running pretty well in both of those races, despite not being a real factor at the end either time; has raced over wet tracks in each of his three starts since breaking his maiden at Saratoga and, even though his Grade 1 Hopeful win came in the slop, he may be able to take a step forward when able to get back over a fast track; don't love him but there are reasons to keep him in mind, especially if he's a price.   -Mike Beer"
"OP",05/02/2020,11,"My Friends Beer","Required a drop in for a $40k tag to get the maiden win in his fifth career start but he has improved since then while placing in each of his three starts since, all of them with ascending figures vs. better horses; obviously in tough here with that topfigure of 81 showing but he will be a big price for an excellent trainer.   -Mike Beer"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"Bravazo","The way he closed out 2018 he seemed poised to have a big 2019; alas, after he was a non-factor 4th in the G1 Pegasus World Cup he wasn't seen for 10 months and hasn't been sharp since; nice to see they're not giving up on him, that they keep him in thisdeeper end of the pool but the way he's run since that long layoff make you wonder if whatever sent him to the bench for so long has taken a few lengths away from him; at least worked very nicely here April 15 but you now have to go back 2 years to findhis last win.   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"Mr Freeze","Looked super blasting rivals in the G2 Gulfstream Park Mile Feb. 29, earning a heady Beyer; was targeting the G2 Godolphin Mile but that race was scrapped; worked well in the interim and while this is a longer trip note he's handled 9fs well before; in fact, his losses the last 3 times he tried it look even better now as he the guys who beat him (Tom's d'Etat, Mucho Gusto) are among the top half-dozen older horses in the land; speed should have him prominent from the start, and if he gets outrun early note a big win from far off the pace at CD in June 2018.   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"Captivating Moon","Can't knock his heart as he always tried and has been pretty reliable with that late run, including finishing decently for 4th in FG's G3 Mineshaft Feb. 16 and for 2nd in FG's G2 New Orleans March 21; trouble is, this is by far the toughest spot he's seen; while he ran on decently in the New Orleans he was no danger to big winner By My Standards and must not only deal with that guy again but a bunch of others who may be even better (Tacitus, Mr. Freeze, Improbable, Combatant, Warrior's Charge, Trophy Chaser, By My Standards, etc.).   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"Sky Promise","Comes here sharp as he rallied from far back to be a near-miss 2nd (to Night Ops) here Feb. 9, then finished resolutely to win a stakes in slop here March 13; that March 13 win came going 1 1/2 miles so it's a different game here, but he's 2 for 4 at this trip so he's not out of his element; still, from a Beyer standpoint he's got work to do if he's to get on terms with the main protagonists here and with his deep-closing style he'll need all the breaks in terms of pace and traffic to get into the mix,not to mention the best race of his life.   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"Combatant","Kept on resolutely to gamely win the G1 Santa Anita Handicap March 7; but let's face it, that wasn't the strongest Big 'Cap renewal we've seen as top West Coast types like McKinzie, Mucho Gusto and Gift Box were not there; still, you can't blame him - hebeat who he has to beat; despite his record this trip the distance is no problem as he's won going longer and shorter; also done good work here so he's no fish out of water in terms of the side; bullet work at SA April 26 says he holds his edge and thatlast big win may be a sign he's a new horse.   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"Warrior's Charge","Won 4 of last 5, the lone loss in that stretch was still good (4th in last year's G1 Preakness); showed courage to win the G3 Razorback here Feb. 17, fending off a tough Asmussen runner in Bankit (who came back to be 3rd in the Oaklawn Mile here April 11behind top-class runners Tom's d'Etat and Improbable); speed is his primary weapon, which is both good and bad; it's good in that it means he can be in the thick of it from the start, but it could be bad as there are at least a couple others in here whohave speed, too; but he's sure trending the right way.   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"Tacitus","That 5th in the G1 Saudi Cup was deceptively good; after all, it was his first start in 5 months and he was facing a thoroughly world-class field, finishing ahead of a number of world-class runners (McKinzie, Magic Wand, for example); was pointing for Dubai but with that program scrapped shifted his gaze toward this and that's encouraging that Mott opted to bring him here; all that being said, he's at times been his own worst enemy, managing to find trouble and maybe snatching defeat from the jaws of victory but if he's matured he can be awfully scary from just off the pace.   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"Trophy Chaser","Trainer Avila said he made a mistake by running this guy in sprints and he wasn't going to make that mistake again and it's worked as the colt romped by 8 1/4 lengths at this trip at GP Feb. 2 (horse who ran 2nd, Scars Are Cool, won nicely here last weekend), then gamely won the G3 Challenger routing at TAM March 7; so, it seems this is the game he wants; speed and versatility give his rider options and he's worked splendidly since; looks as though he's figuring out things and while it's his first timehere he's handled numerous other places so that shouldn't be an issue.   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"Improbable","So who did he tick off at OP?; got the worst of the draw with a far-outside post in the Oaklawn Mile here April 11, and the worst of the draw here again stuck on the far outside; at least if he behaves at the gate and breaks he's got the speed to get position without having to make the top, as he did in the Oaklawn Mile; his 2nd that day was excellent as he was wide throughout, opened up into the lane only to get nailed by one of the game's best, Tom's d'Etat; it was also his first start in 5 months sohe could be fitter and tougher; but geez, that draw...   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"By My Standards","Had a miserable time of it in last spring's G1 Ky. Derby as he was troubled and no factor at any point, ending up 12th (awarded11th via DQ); wasn't seen again for 9 months but he's come back smokin' with a romp in an FG optional claimer Feb. 9 and another romp in the G2 New Orleans there March 21; apparently has come back bigger and badder and he's worked superbly since; must deal with new surroundings but he's certainly got game and if ready to take another step forward could be more than a little scary at a trip he handles very nicely.   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"Night Ops","Comes here sharp having won 3 of his last 4, the last 2 wins coming over this track this meet including a SW last time out March 15; in fact, his best work may have come here (3 of his 5 wins); worked well since and could be in line for a nice trip sitting not too far off the pace but ahead of the deep closers; even so, the draw is lousy and it's worth noting Talamo, who was up for those last 2 wins, ends up on Mr. Freeze today instead, so read into that what you will...though it's never a bad thing toget Castellano to do the steering.   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"Identifier","Rallied smartly from far back to post a 60-1 upset in the G3 Hal's Hope at this trip at GP March 28; that was a 2nd straight win and makes him 2 for 2 at this 9f trip; and while he came from well out of it March 28 note plenty of outings where he showedtactical speed so he's by no means some one-dimensional deep closer; that said, the Beyer earned in his Hal's Hope leaves him with work to do if he's to challenge here, but it was a career-top and maybe he's got another forward move in him that can get him into the mix...maybe.   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"Tax","Awfully game when 2nd in AQU's G3 Discoverty, chasing home a very, very nice McGaughey runner (Performer); couldn't quite finish with that foe but ended up over 9 lengths clear of 3rd; that sent him into the G1 Pegasus World Cup at GP Jan. 25 seemingly as a contender but after stumbling at the start he was no factor at any point; Gargan opted to give him time to regroup and the 4yo has worked very nicely for this; top Beyers show he's got the necessary oomph to be in the mix and his tactical speed and versatility give his rider options.   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,12,"Chess Chief","A terrific renewal; wasn't disgraced when 3rd in the G2 New Orleans at FG last time out March 21 (was DQ'd to 6th); trouble is, he finished well behind winner By My Standards and must not only deal with that foe again, but a bunch of other real toughies;only prior start here wasn't too hot either (ran 6th), though in his defense he was sluggish early and left with far too much to do; still, the water is awfully deep here and he likely has to run a race he hasn't run yet just to get into the mix.   -Michael Hammersly"
"OP",05/02/2020,13,"Fast Enough","Reportedly emerged from his last workout with a shin injury and will be SCRATCHED.   -Dan Illman"
"OP",05/02/2020,13,"King Guillermo","Pulled off a 49 to 1 shocker in the Tampa Bay Derby with a big effort that resulted in a whopping 99 Beyer; broke out a bit, but was soon righted to prompt the pace three wide; continued to push the pace from the outside on the turn, made the front moving into the stretch and wasn't threatened late; the timing of this race works out perfectly as the original plan was to train right up to the Kentucky Derby; don't believe he's as quick as either Nadal or Wells Bayou and will have to prove he's as effective from just off the pace as he is when he's one of the pacesetters; this is a tougher field than the Tampa Bay Derby, but think he'll sit a nice trip in third or fourth and should be in the thick of things when the real racing begins; contender.   -Dan Illman"
"OP",05/02/2020,13,"Taishan","Couldn't get close to leading 3-year-old Authentic in seasonal debut, but broke a beat slow and was in and among horses for the first half-mile; treating the Southwest with several grains of salt; after bobbling at the start and trying to get forward, hewas taken in hand on the clubhouse turn and ended up five wide for most of the way while the winner, Silver Prospector, rode the rail to the quarter pole; although only third in the Oaklawn Stakes, he ran very well; stalked the fast splits outside, madea strong four-wide bid to take over with two furlongs remaining and succumbed to two deep closers that benefited from those quick fractions up front; think he can work out a midpack trip here behind a solid pace; some price potential.   -Dan Illman"
"OP",05/02/2020,13,"Code Runner","His lone stakes race to date was truly a disappointment as he never picked up his feet; think sprinting won't ultimately be his game so willing to forgive the 12 1/4-length defeat at the hooves of top-class Long Weekend two back (that colt came back to win the Gazebo with a 95 Beyer and the Bachelor with a 98); received a confidence boost when stretched back out around two turns last time at Sam Houston; raced in a loose pocket at the back of the pack, steadily advanced on the battling leaders on the turn, angled three wide into the stretch and eventually got away in the final sixteenth; all-star trainer coupled with long-distance pedigree gives him a puncher's chance if the pace is fast, but think he's in a bit too tough.   -Dan Illman"
"OP",05/02/2020,13,"Saratogian","Eligible for a non-winners of two condition, this seems like a tough spot for the colt's two-turn debut; dismissed at giant odds in his first start against winners, he tracked the pace three wide, tried to get into it with a four-wide bid while under aheavy drive on the turn and called it a day at the top of the stretch; Brisset is 3 for 11 (27%) with a $5.10 ROI over the past three years with 3-year-old dirt routers in graded stakes races; takes a huge step up in class and his Beyers pale in comparison to those of the top contenders; leaning elsewhere.   -Dan Illman"
"OP",05/02/2020,13,"Finnick the Fierce","Generally a one-run closer, this gelding showed better tactical speed en route to being placed first via disqualification in local prep; did not break well at all (an annoying habit he's developed), but shot the gap along the inside going into the firstturn to work out a pocket trip; split horses at the five-sixteenths, then dove back to the rail in the stretch and finished evenly through a tight spot on the fence; should get a nice pace to attack here, but it's worth noting that his two fastest racesto date have come on wet tracks and he flopped back to his left lead in the waning stages of the slower division of the Risen Star; probably can't afford a slow start against this caliber of competition; needs a Beyer boost; prefer others.   -Dan Illman"
"OP",05/02/2020,13,"Wells Bayou","Thought this speedy colt ran well in a very fast edition of the Southwest, but ended up second best to Silver Prospector; shipped to Fair Grounds for the Louisiana Derby and did not disappoint as the favorite; Geroux was really aggressive leaving the stalls and Wells Bayou, although having to go fast early, was able to obtain an uncontested lead; there wasn't much closing going on in that race as they ran 1-2 all the way around the track; different scenario likely here as the colt projects to be chasingNadal through some solid fractions; he's earned some competitive Beyer Speed Figures, but is going to have to work hard from the opening bell; capable, but demand value before plunging on the win end.   -Dan Illman"
"OP",05/02/2020,13,"Nadal","Undefeated colt looked super working hard from start to finish in his two-turn debut; making his first start over a sloppy track and first outside of California, he was gunned to the lead and was immediately confronted by No Parole (finished last) and American Theorem (finished seventh); battled hard with the latter through fast fractions, finally tucked that one into bed at the five-sixteenths, then somehow held off the closers; might not have to work as hard to make the lead here, but figures to facepressure from Wells Bayou at some point on the backstretch; think he has enough pedigree to get the extra distance (sire won BC Classic; one of dam's half-siblings a stakes-winner on turf at 12 furlongs); the one to beat.   -Dan Illman"
"OP",05/02/2020,13,"Silver Prospector","On his best day, this colt can step with nice horses; upset Tiz the Law, one of the divisional leaders, in the Kentucky Jockey Club and took down Wells Bayou in the Southwest; has excuses for the Smarty Jones as there was no pace and the winner, Gold Street, is a mud-loving speed horse that controlled that glacial tempo; advanced into the fast pace along the inside on the backstretch in the Rebel to race just behind Nadal turning for home; squeezed in between horses when one-paced and may not have appreciated the wet track; wouldn't be surprised if he's ridden more patiently to come with one late bid; rock-solid colt shouldn't be taken lightly, but prefer on bottom of single-race exotics.   -Dan Illman"
"OP",05/02/2020,13,"Storm the Court","Upset winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and last year's 2-year-old champion might be cycling back to his best as he makes his third start of the form cycle; no match for Nadal in the San Vicente, but willing to give him the benefit of the doubt off the layoff at a distance likely shorter than his best; faced two of the best in the country in Authentic and Honor A. P. in the San Felipe; prompted the winner from the outside, but was being shoved on entering the far turn and finished evenly to be a non-threatening third; he's always had good tactical speed and can work out a nice trip in the second flight behind the expected quick pace; despite his accomplishments, he's still pretty underrated; prefer on bottom of single-race exotics.   -Dan Illman"
"OP",05/02/2020,13,"Farmington Road","Late-runner seems to be blossoming at the right time for a Pletcher barn that is 4 for 9 (44%) with a $3.22 ROI over the past four years with 3-year-old dirt routers in graded stakes at Oaklawn; after graduating against weak maidens in two-turn debut atTampa Bay, he swung widest turning for home in the faster division of the Risen Star and made up some late ground; along with the winner, Mr. Big News, he took advantage of a blistering pace in the Oaklawn Stakes last month; hit the side of the gate at the start, split horses three wide entering the final turn, followed the winner under heavy urging turning into the stretch and was gaining late; should get another solid pace to attack here and should be charging in the lane; prefer 'underneath'   -Dan Illman"
